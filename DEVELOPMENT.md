# Development Guide

This document explains the structure of the `mlinit` repository and how to work with it.

## 📂 Repository Structure

*   **`mlinit/`**: This is the **source code** of the tool.
    *   `cli.py`: The command-line interface entry point.
    *   `core.py`: The main logic that coordinates everything.
    *   `generator.py`: Handles creating directories and files.
    *   `templates/`: Contains the Jinja2 templates (e.g., `train.py.j2`) used to generate files.
*   **`pyproject.toml`**: The **configuration file** for the project. It defines dependencies, version, and build settings.
*   **`MANIFEST.in`**: Tells the build system to include non-Python files (like our templates in `mlinit/templates/`) when packaging.
*   **`README.md`**: The main documentation for users.
*   **`PUBLISHING.md`**: Instructions for releasing to PyPI.

## 🚫 Ignored Directories (Do Not Commit)

When you run commands like `pip install .` or `python -m build`, Python creates several temporary directories. **You should NOT commit these to Git.**

*   **`build/`**: Temporary files created during the build process.
*   **`dist/`**: Contains the final built packages (`.whl` and `.tar.gz`) ready for upload to PyPI.
*   **`mlinit.egg-info/`**: Metadata generated by pip/setuptools about the package.
*   **`__pycache__/`**: Compiled Python files (speed up loading).
*   **`test_project/`, `cv_project/`**: These are test projects you generated locally.

## 🛠 Common Tasks

### 1. Install Locally (for testing)
Updates your environment to use the code in this folder.
```bash
pip install .
```

### 2. Build for Release
Creates the files in `dist/`.
```bash
python -m build
```

### 3. Clean Up
If you want to reset the directory to a clean state, you can safely delete:
*   `build/`
*   `dist/`
*   `*.egg-info/`
*   Any generated test project folders.
